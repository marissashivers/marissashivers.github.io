<h2>My Research at K-State</h2>
I got involved with research after my freshman year, when I applied and was accepted into 
the Kansas Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation (KS-LSAMP) Research Immersion: Pathways to STEM (RiPS) program. 
After that, I officially joined K-State's Laboratory for Knowledge Discovery in Databases as an 
undergraduate research programmer.
