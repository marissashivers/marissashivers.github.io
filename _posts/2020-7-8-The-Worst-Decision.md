title: The Worst Decision is Indecision
---

One of the most challenging things I’ve faced when trying to learn artificial intelligence and machine learning on my own is finding an online course that I’m able to stick to. Of course, there are countless resources out there for free (some of my favorites being fast.ai, Coursera, and freeCodeCamp). There are even multiple YouTube playlists of entire Stanford courses for machine learning, deep learning, and natural language processing. With so many options, it seems like it wouldn’t be too difficult to find one that fit my needs. However, that’s the exact problem I face: choosing one. 

## Where do I start?

Whenever someone asks me how to get started with machine learning, I never know how to answer them, because I don’t even know the answer myself. There’s so many options for which learning path to take, but one of the main issues myself and others run into is deciding between taking a deep dive into the fundamentals of machine learning, or simply being able to train a model on PyTorch. While the former would be ideal, the latter is often more practical and less time-consuming.

Even though there are numerous options for completing the latter, I always ask myself, “why should it have to be a choice? Why can’t I do both?” So I do, and I try to dig deep into the fine-grained details of machine learning and how gradient descent works, and I wind up becoming quickly discouraged when I can’t code a neural network from scratch.

## But wait, aren’t there frameworks that help with that?

Of course, there are so many wonderful frameworks like PyTorch, TensorFlow, and Scikit-Learn out there. That’s the purpose of them – to make machine learning easier for a developer and help get projects off the ground. But despite the beauty that these frameworks provide, I always find myself wondering what lies under the hood and allows them to work. I have never wanted to be someone who just simply copied and pasted code without really understanding what it was doing – so I took another attempt at diving in. It very quickly became a continuous cycle of curiosity and frustration.

## Just Do It

I soon realized that I needed to avoid dwelling on every single question I encountered, because not all concepts can be explained that easily, especially without sufficient background knowledge. Oftentimes I would find myself going off on a tangent attempting to find the answer to my question, when I would have been better off just sticking to the current course I was working on. And that’s what I’ve been doing for the past few months. So for now, I’m just going to buckle down, stick to one course, and finish it – even if I’m dying to know how exactly this all works. After all, the best, self-starter way of mastering machine learning is to just “do it”. 

I realize that I still have a lot of learning to do, and I’m excited to do so. I’m thankful for the opportunities that have gotten me to where I am today. Even if learning comes with occasional struggles and frustration, I’m ready for whatever challenges come my way and look forward to what I will learn next.
